					<h3>About Archit</h3>
					<p>Though it’s only Archit’s first year in this organization, he’s already fallen in love with the message and goals of NextGen. As Publicity Officer, his goal is to help NextGen expand into as many different libraries as possible, to ensure that the organization can affect as many lives as possible. Despite working with NextGen, Archit helps cultivate tomorrow’s leaders through an organization he founded, Junior Coding League, which aims to teach children how to leverage their programming abilities to make a difference in the world. Archit also works in Humans For Healing, JSA, Relay For Life, TSA, and several other clubs that he is passionate about. Regardless, Archit is convinced that, along with NextGen, he can make a huge difference in the lives of thousands of students throughout the WWP district!</p>
