					<h3>About Chaitana</h3>
					<p>Over the past 3 years coaching kids from around the West Windsor-Plainsboro community, Chaitanya’s belief in preparing children to become the leaders of tomorrow is what drives his passion for WWP NextGen. Now a senior at WW-P High School North and President of the organization, Chaitanya hopes that the events and workshops that he executes along with the help of so many dedicated volunteers will help change the lives of kids in his community for the better. Besides WWP NextGen, Chaitanya loves helping fellow students perfect their own TED talks as part of his school’s TED-Ed Club, and can be seen diligently raising funds for the March of Dimes. In his free time, you’ll find Chaitanya biking with his friends or nose-deep in a good book on his Kindle, so feel free to drop by for some recommendations on books that’ll change your outlook on life! That being said, Chaitanya is looking forward to an amazing last year ahead of him, and can’t wait to lead this youth organization to new heights down the line!</p>
